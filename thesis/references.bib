abstract="Finite domain propagation solvers effectively represent the possible values of variables by a set of choices which can be naturally modelled as Boolean variables. In this paper we describe how to mimic a finite domain propagation engine, by mapping propagators into clauses in a SAT solver. This immediately results in strong nogoods for finite domain propagation. But a naive static translation is impractical except in limited cases. We show how to convert propagators to lazy clause generators for a SAT solver. The resulting system introduces flexibility in modelling since variables are modelled dually in the propagation engine and the SAT solver, and we explore various approaches to the dual modelling. We show that the resulting system solves many finite domain problems significantly faster than other techniques.",

abstract="The global cumulative constraint was proposed for modelling cumulative resources in scheduling problems for finite domain (FD) propagation. Since that time a great deal of research has investigated new stronger and faster filtering techniques for cumulative, but still most of these techniques only pay off in limited cases or are not scalable. Recently, the ``lazy clause generation'' hybrid solving approach has been devised which allows a finite domain propagation engine possible to take advantage of advanced SAT technology, by ``lazily'' creating a SAT model of an FD problem as computation progresses. This allows the solver to make use of SAT explanation and autonomous search capabilities. In this article we show how, once we use lazy clause generation, modelling the cumulative constraint by decomposition creates a highly competitive version of cumulative. Using decomposition into component parts automatically makes the propagator incremental and able to explain itself. We then show how, using the insights from the behaviour of the decomposition, we can create global cumulative constraints that explain their propagation. We compare these approaches to explaining the cumulative constraint on resource constrained project scheduling problems. All our methods are able to close a substantial number of open problems from the well-established PSPlib benchmark library of resource-constrained project scheduling problems.",

abstract="We present a generic exact method for minimizing the project duration of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with generalized precedence relations (Rcpsp/max). This is a very general scheduling model with applications areas such as project management and production planning. Our method uses lazy clause generation, i.e., a hybrid of finite domain and Boolean satisfiability solving, in order to apply no-good learning and conflict-driven search to the solution generation. Our experiments show the benefit of lazy clause generation for finding an optimal solution and proving its optimality in comparison to other state-of-the-art exact and non-exact methods. In comparison to other methods, our method is able to find better solutions faster on the Rcpsp/max benchmarks. Indeed, our method closes 573 open problem instances and generates better solutions in most of the remaining instances. Surprisingly, although ours is an exact method, it outperforms the published non-exact methods on these benchmarks in terms of the quality of solutions.",

In the latter problem, a set I of n operations has to be scheduled without preemption on m identical processors in order to minimize the makespan. Each operation i has a release date (or head) ri, a processing time pi , and a tail qi. In the cumulative scheduling problem (CuSP), an operation i requires a constant amount ei of processors throughout its processing. A CuSP is obtained, for instance, from the resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) by choosing a resource and relaxing the constraints induced by the other resources. We state new properties on \{JPPS\} and we show that it can be used for studying the CuSP and for performing adjustments of heads and tails using a strategy very close to the one designed by Carlier and Pinson for the 1/ri, qi/Cmax sequencing problem. It confirms the interest of \{JPPS\} for solving RCPSP. "

title="Constraint Propagation and Decomposition Techniques for Highly Disjunctive and Highly Cumulative Project Scheduling Problems",
journal="Constraints",
year="2000",
volume="5",
number="1",
pages="119--139",
abstract="In recent years, constraint satisfaction techniques have been successfully applied to ``disjunctive'' scheduling problems, i.e., scheduling problems where each resource can execute at most one activity at a time. Less significant and less generally applicable results have been obtained in the area of ``cumulative'' scheduling. Multiple constraint propagation algorithms have been developed for cumulative resources but they tend to be less uniformly effective than their disjunctive counterparts. Different problems in the cumulative scheduling class seem to have different characteristics that make them either easy or hard to solve with a given technique. The aim of this paper is to investigate one particular dimension along which problems differ. Within the cumulative scheduling class, we distinguish between ``highly disjunctive'' and ``highly cumulative'' problems: a problem is highly disjunctive when many pairs of activities cannot execute in parallel, e.g., because many activities require more than half of the capacity of a resource; on the contrary, a problem is highly cumulative if many activities can effectively execute in parallel. New constraint propagation and problem decomposition techniques are introduced with this distinction in mind. This includes an O(n2) ``edge-finding'' algorithm for cumulative resources (where n is the number of activities requiring the same resource) and a problem decomposition scheme which applies well to highly disjunctive project scheduling problems. Experimental results confirm that the impact of these techniques varies from highly disjunctive to highly cumulative problems. In the end, we also propose a refined version of the ``edge-finding'' algorithm for cumulative resources which, despite its worst case complexity in O(n3) , performs very well on highly cumulative instances.",

abstract="The ability to model search in a constraint solver can be an essential asset for solving combinatorial problems. However, existing infrastructure for defining search heuristics is often inadequate. Either modeling capabilities are extremely limited or users are faced with a general-purpose programming language whose features are not tailored towards writing search heuristics. As a result, major improvements in performance may remain unexplored. This article introduces search combinators, a lightweight and solver-independent method that bridges the gap between a conceptually simple modeling language for search (high-level, functional and naturally compositional) and an efficient implementation (low-level, imperative and highly non-modular). By allowing the user to define application-tailored search strategies from a small set of primitives, search combinators effectively provide a rich domain-specific language (DSL) for modeling search to the user. Remarkably, this DSL comes at a low implementation cost to the developer of a constraint solver. The article discusses two modular implementation approaches and shows, by empirical evaluation, that search combinators can be implemented without overhead compared to a native, direct implementation in a constraint solver.",

abstract="J. F. Benders devised a clever approach for exploiting the structure of mathematical programming problems withcomplicating variables (variables which, when temporarily fixed, render the remaining optimization problem considerably more tractable). For the class of problems specifically considered by Benders, fixing the values of the complicating variables reduces the given problem to an ordinary linear program, parameterized, of course, by the value of the complicating variables vector. The algorithm he proposed for finding the optimal value of this vector employs a cutting-plane approach for building up adequate representations of (i) the extremal value of the linear program as a function of the parameterizing vector and (ii) the set of values of the parameterizing vector for which the linear program is feasible. Linear programming duality theory was employed to derive the natural families ofcuts characterizing these representations, and the parameterized linear program itself is used to generate what are usuallydeepest cuts for building up the representations.",

abstract="{\enspace}Benders decomposition uses a strategy of ``learning from one's mistakes.'' The aim of this paper is to extend this strategy to a much larger class of problems. The key is to generalize the linear programming dual used in the classical method to an ``inference dual.'' Solution of the inference dual takes the form of a logical deduction that yields Benders cuts. The dual is therefore very different from other generalized duals that have been proposed. The approach is illustrated by working out the details for propositional satisfiability and 0-1 programming problems. Computational tests are carried out for the latter, but the most promising contribution of logic-based Benders may be to provide a framework for combining optimization and constraint programming methods.",

We solve minimum cost problems, as well as minimum makespan problems in which all tasks have the same release date and deadline.

We define and emphasize the importance, applications, and benefits of explicitly considering setup times/costs in scheduling research. Moreover, a review of the latest research on scheduling problems with setup times/costs is provided. "

abstract = "The first comprehensive survey paper on scheduling problems with separate setup times or costs was conducted by [Allahverdi, A., Gupta, J.N.D., Aldowaisan, T., 1999. A review of scheduling research involving setup considerations. \{OMEGA\} The International Journal of Management Sciences 27, 219–239], who reviewed the literature since the mid-1960s. Since the appearance of that survey paper, there has been an increasing interest in scheduling problems with setup times (costs) with an average of more than 40 papers per year being added to the literature. The objective of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the scheduling literature on models with setup times (costs) from then to date covering more than 300 papers. Given that so many papers have appeared in a short time, there are cases where different researchers addressed the same problem independently, and sometimes by using even the same technique, e.g., genetic algorithm. Throughout the paper we identify such areas where independently developed techniques need to be compared. The paper classifies scheduling problems into those with batching and non-batching considerations, and with sequence-independent and sequence-dependent setup times. It further categorizes the literature according to shop environments, including single-machine, parallel machines, flow shop, no-wait flow shop, flexible flow shop, job shop, open shop, and others. "

abstract = "Abstract Scheduling involving setup times/costs plays an important role in today's modern manufacturing and service environments for the delivery of reliable products on time. The setup process is not a value added factor, and hence, setup times/costs need to be explicitly considered while scheduling decisions are made in order to increase productivity, eliminate waste, improve resource utilization, and meet deadlines. However, the vast majority of existing scheduling literature, more than 90 percent, ignores this fact. The interest in scheduling problems where setup times/costs are explicitly considered began in the mid-1960s and the interest has been increasing even though not at an anticipated level. The first comprehensive review paper (Allahverdi et al., 1999) on scheduling problems with setup times/costs was in 1999 covering about 200 papers, from mid-1960s to mid-1988, while the second comprehensive review paper (Allahverdi et al., 2008) covered about 300 papers which were published from mid-1998 to mid-2006. This paper is the third comprehensive survey paper which provides an extensive review of about 500 papers that have appeared since the mid-2006 to the end of 2014, including static, dynamic, deterministic, and stochastic environments. This review paper classifies scheduling problems based on shop environments as single machine, parallel machine, flowshop, job shop, or open shop. It further classifies the problems as family and non-family as well as sequence-dependent and sequence-independent setup times/costs. Given that so many papers have been published in a relatively short period of time, different researchers have addressed the same problem independently, by even using the same methodology. Throughout the survey paper, the independently addressed problems are identified, and need for comparing these results is emphasized. Moreover, based on performance measures, shop and setup times/costs environments, the less studied problems have been identified and the need to address these problems is specified. The current survey paper, along with those of Allahverdi et al. (1999, 2008), is an up to date survey of scheduling problems involving static, dynamic, deterministic, and stochastic problems for different shop environments with setup times/costs since the first research on the topic appeared in the mid-1960s.
